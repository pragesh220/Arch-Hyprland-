#: fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. you can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

# font_family      monospace
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: you can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. the easiest way to select fonts is to run the `kitten
#: choose-fonts` command which will present a nice ui for you to
#: select the fonts you want with previews and support for selecting
#: variable fonts and font features. if you want to learn to select
#: fonts manually, read the font specification syntax
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/choose-fonts/#font-spec-
#: syntax>.

 font_size 12.0

#: font size (in pts).

# force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support bidi (bidirectional text), however, for rtl
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in rtl. that is to say,
#: in an rtl script, the words "hello world" display in kitty as
#: "world hello", and if you try to select a substring of an rtl-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the string been ltr. for example, assuming the hebrew word ירושלים,
#: selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם actually
#: writes into the selection buffer the character י. kitty's default
#: behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse the word
#: order, however, if you wish to manipulate rtl glyphs, it can be
#: very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to turn
#: it off. furthermore, this option can be used with the command line
#: program gnu fribidi <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable>
#: to get bidi support, because it will force kitty to always treat
#: the text as ltr, which fribidi expects for terminals.

# symbol_map

#: e.g. symbol_map u+e0a0-u+e0a3,u+e0c0-u+e0c7 powerlinesymbols

#: map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: powerline. avoids the need for patched fonts. each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form `u+<code point in hexadecimal>`. you
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. this option can be specified multiple times.
#: the syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints font family name

# narrow_symbols

#: e.g. narrow_symbols u+e0a0-u+e0a3,u+e0c0-u+e0c7 1

#: usually, for private use unicode characters and some symbol/dingbat
#: characters, if the character is followed by one or more spaces,
#: kitty will use those extra cells to render the character larger, if
#: the character in the font has a wide aspect ratio. using this
#: option you can force kitty to restrict the specified code points to
#: render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).
#: this option can be specified multiple times. the syntax is::

#:     narrow_symbols codepoints [optionally the number of cells]

# disable_ligatures never

#: choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. the
#: default is to always render them. you can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. the ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt opentype feature. for disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features option.

# font_features

#: e.g. font_features none

#: choose exactly which opentype features to enable or disable. note
#: that for the main fonts, features can be specified when selecting
#: the font using the choose-fonts kitten. this setting is useful for
#: fallback fonts.

#: some fonts might have features worthwhile in a terminal. for
#: example, fira code includes a discretionary feature, zero, which in
#: that font changes the appearance of the zero (0), to make it more
#: easily distinguishable from ø. fira code also includes other
#: discretionary features known as stylistic sets which have the tags
#: ss01 through ss20.

#: for the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: harfbuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: note that this code is indexed by postscript name, and not the font
#: family. this allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: on linux, font features are first read from the fontconfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: to get the postscript name for a font, use the `fc-scan file.ttf`
#: command on linux or the `font book tool on macos
#: <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79875/how-can-i-get-the-
#: postscript-name-of-a-ttf-font-installed-in-os-x>`__.

#: enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features firacode-retina +zero +onum

#: enable only alternate zero in the bold font::

#:     font_features firacode-bold +zero

#: disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features tt2020styleb-regular -liga +calt

#: in conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. you can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features unifontmedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# modify_font

#: modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. the modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. no
#: suffix means use pts. for example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. for example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

#: note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode characters.
#: these values are in pts. they will be scaled by the monitor dpi to
#: arrive at a pixel value. there must be four values corresponding to
#: thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

# undercurl_style thin-sparse

#: the style with which undercurls are rendered. this option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. with sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice. changing this option dynamically via reloading
#: the config or remote control is undefined.

# underline_exclusion 1

#: by default kitty renders gaps in underlines when they overlap with
#: descenders (the parts of letters below the baseline, such as for y,
#: q, p etc.). this option controls the thickness of the gaps. it can
#: be either a unitless number in which case it is a fraction of the
#: underline thickness as specified in the font or it can have a
#: suffix of px for pixels or pt for points. set to zero to disable
#: the gaps. changing this option dynamically via reloading the config
#: or remote control is undefined.

# text_composition_strategy platform

#: control how kitty composites text glyphs onto the background color.
#: the default value of platform tries for text rendering as close to
#: "native" for the platform kitty is running on as possible.

#: a value of legacy uses the old (pre kitty 0.28) strategy for how
#: glyphs are composited. this will make dark text on light
#: backgrounds look thicker and light text on dark backgrounds
#: thinner. it might also make some text appear like the strokes are
#: uneven.

#: you can fine tune the actual contrast curve used for glyph
#: composition by specifying up to two space-separated numbers for
#: this setting.

#: the first number is the gamma adjustment, which controls the
#: thickness of dark text on light backgrounds. increasing the value
#: will make text appear thicker. the default value for this is 1.0 on
#: linux and 1.7 on macos. valid values are 0.01 and above. the result
#: is scaled based on the luminance difference between the background
#: and the foreground. dark text on light backgrounds receives the
#: full impact of the curve while light text on dark backgrounds is
#: affected very little.

#: the second number is an additional multiplicative contrast. it is
#: percentage ranging from 0 to 100. the default value is 0 on linux
#: and 30 on macos.

#: if you wish to achieve similar looking thickness in light and dark
#: themes, a good way to experiment is start by setting the value to
#: 1.0 0 and use a dark theme. then adjust the second parameter until
#: it looks good. then switch to a light theme and adjust the first
#: parameter until the perceived thickness matches the dark theme.

# text_fg_override_threshold 0

#: a setting to prevent low contrast between foreground and background
#: colors. useful when working with applications that use colors that
#: do not contrast well with your preferred color scheme. the default
#: value is 0, which means no color overriding is performed. there are
#: two modes of operation:

#: a value with the suffix ratio represents the minimum accepted
#: contrast ratio between the foreground and background color.
#: possible values range from 0.0 ratio to 21.0 ratio. for example, to
#: meet wcag level aa
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_content_accessibility_guidelines>
#: a value of 4.5 ratio can be provided. the algorithm is implemented
#: using hsluv <https://www.hsluv.org/> which enables it to change the
#: perceived lightness of a color just as much as needed without
#: really changing its hue and saturation.

#: a value with the suffix % represents the minimum accepted
#: difference in luminance between the foreground and background
#: color, below which kitty will override the foreground color. it is
#: percentage ranging from 0 % to 100 %. if the difference in
#: luminance of the foreground and background is below this threshold,
#: the foreground color will be set to white if the background is dark
#: or black if the background is light.

#: warning: some programs use characters (such as block characters)
#: for graphics display and may expect to be able to set the
#: foreground and background to the same color (or similar colors). if
#: you see unexpected stripes, dots, lines, incorrect color, no color
#: where you expect color, or any kind of graphic display problem try
#: setting text_fg_override_threshold to 0 to see if this is the cause
#: of the problem or consider using the ratio mode of operation
#: described above instead of the % mode of operation.

#: }}}

#: text cursor customization {{{

# cursor #cccccc

#: default text cursor color. if set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

# cursor_text_color #111111

#: the color of text under the cursor. if you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

# cursor_shape block

#: the cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. this
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. in particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. you can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

# cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: defines the text cursor shape when the os window is not focused.
#: the unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline,
#: hollow and unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

# cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: the thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: the thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

# cursor_blink_interval -1

#: the interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). set to zero to
#: disable blinking. negative values mean use system default. note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay. you can
#: also animate the cursor blink by specifying an easing function. for
#: example, setting this to option to 0.5 ease-in-out will cause the
#: cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the
#: second it will go from opaque to transparent and then back again
#: over the next half. you can specify different easing functions for
#: the two halves, for example: -1 linear ease-out. kitty supports all
#: the css easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: us/docs/web/css/easing-function>. note that turning on animations
#: uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple times
#: per blink interval. see also, cursor_stop_blinking_after. this
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. set to zero to never stop blinking. this
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

 cursor_trail 1

#: set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail"
#: animation. this is an animation that shows a "trail" following the
#: movement of the text cursor. it makes it easy to follow large
#: cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor
#: zooming around the screen. the actual value of this option controls
#: when the animation is triggered. it is a number of milliseconds.
#: the trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their
#: position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. this
#: prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change
#: their positions during ui updates in complex applications. see
#: cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and
#: cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is
#: started.

 cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

#: controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the
#: cursor_trail is enabled. this option accepts two positive float
#: values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds.
#: the first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum),
#: and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time
#: (maximum). the second value must be equal to or greater than the
#: first value. smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor
#: trail. adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail
#: fades away.

# cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

#: set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. this
#: option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum
#: number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started.
#: when the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is
#: skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.

# cursor_trail_color none

#: set the color of the cursor trail when cursor_trail is enabled. if
#: set to 'none' (the default), the cursor trail will use the cursor's
#: background color. otherwise, specify a color value (e.g., #ff0000
#: for red, or a named color like 'red'). this allows you to customize
#: the appearance of the cursor trail independently of the cursor
#: color.

#: }}}

#: scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: memory is allocated on demand. negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of ram. instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollbar scrolled

#: control when the scrollbar is displayed.

#: scrolled
#:     means when the scrolling backwards has started.
#: hovered
#:     means when the mouse is hovering on the right edge of the window.
#: scrolled-and-hovered
#:     means when the mouse is over the scrollbar region *and* scrolling backwards has started.
#: always
#:     means whenever any scrollback is present
#: never
#:     means disable the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_interactive yes

#: if disabled, the scrollbar will not be controllable via th emouse
#: and all mouse events will pass through the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_jump_on_click yes

#: when enabled clicking in the scrollbar track will cause the scroll
#: position to jump to the clicked location, otherwise the scroll
#: position will only move towards the position by a single screenful,
#: which is how traditional scrollbars behave.

# scrollbar_width 0.5

#: the width of the scroll bar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_hover_width 1

#: the width of the scroll bar when the mouse is hovering over it, in
#: units of cell width.

# scrollbar_handle_opacity 0.5

#: the opacity of the scrollbar handle, 0 being fully transparent and
#: 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_radius 0.3

#: the radius (curvature) of the scrollbar handle in units of cell
#: width. should be less than scrollbar_width.

# scrollbar_gap 0.1

#: the gap between the scrollbar and the window edge in units of cell
#: width.

# scrollbar_min_handle_height 1

#: the minimum height of the scrollbar handle in units of cell height.
#: prevents the handle from becoming too small when there is a lot of
#: scrollback.

# scrollbar_hitbox_expansion 0.25

#: the extra area around the handle to allow easier grabbing of the
#: scollbar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_track_opacity 0

#: the opacity of the scrollbar track, 0 being fully transparent and 1
#: being full opaque.

# scrollbar_track_hover_opacity 0.1

#: the opacity of the scrollbar track when the mouse is over the
#: scrollbar, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_handle_color foreground

#: the color of the scrollbar handle. a value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollbar_track_color foreground

#: the color of the scrollbar track. a value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --raw-control-chars +input_line_number

#: program with which to view scrollback in a new window. the
#: scrollback buffer is passed as stdin to this program. if you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ansi escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. input_line_number in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. similarly cursor_line and
#: cursor_column will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

#: if you would rather use neovim to view the scrollback, use
#: something like this::

#:     scrollback_pager nvim --cmd 'set eventignore=filetype' +'nnoremap q zq' +'call nvim_open_term(0, {})' +'set nomodified nolist' +'$' -

#: the above works for neovim 0.12 and newer. there is also a
#: dedicated plugin kitty-scrollback.nvim
#: <https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim> you can use
#: with more features that works with older neovim as well.

# scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: separate scrollback history size (in mb), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. this separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. the
#: current implementation stores the data in utf-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ascii,
#: unformatted text. a value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: the maximum allowed size is 4gb. note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macos
#: and wayland. use negative numbers to change scroll direction. see
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

# wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: the minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. the scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. with a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

# touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macos and wayland. use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: mouse {{{

# mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. disabled by default on macos as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is cocoa is too
#: much effort.

#: by default, once the cursor is hidden, it is immediately unhidden
#: on any further mouse events.

#: two formats are supported:
#:  - <hide-wait>
#:  - <hide-wait> <unhide-wait> <unhide-threshold> <scroll-unhide>

#: to change the unhide behavior, the optional parameters <unhide-
#: wait>, <unhide-threshold>, and <scroll-unhide> may be set.

#: <unhide-wait>
#:     waits for the specified number of seconds after mouse events before unhiding the
#:     mouse cursor. set to zero to unhide mouse cursor immediately on mouse activity.
#:     this is useful to prevent the mouse cursor from unhiding on accidental swipes on
#:     the trackpad.

#: <unhide-threshold>
#:     sets the threshold of mouse activity required to unhide the mouse cursor, when
#:     the <unhide-wait> option is non-zero. when <unhide-wait> is zero, this has no
#:     effect.

#:     for example, if <unhide-threshold> is 40 and <unhide-wait> is 2.5, when kitty
#:     detects a mouse event, it records the number of mouse events in the next 2.5
#:     seconds, and checks if that exceeds 40 * 2.5 = 100. if it does, then the mouse
#:     cursor is unhidden, otherwise nothing happens.

#: <scroll-unhide>
#:     controls what mouse events may unhide the mouse cursor. if enabled, both scroll
#:     and movement events may unhide the cursor. if disabled, only mouse movements can
#:     unhide the cursor.

#: examples of valid values:
#:  - 0.0
#:  - 1.0
#:  - -1.0
#:  - 0.1 3.0 40 yes

# url_color #0087bd
# url_style curly

#: the color and style for highlighting urls on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

# open_url_with default

#: the program to open clicked urls. the special value default will
#: first look for any url handlers defined via the open_actions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/open_actions/> facility and if non
#: are found, it will use the operating system's default url handler
#: (open on macos and xdg-open on linux).

# url_prefixes file ftp ftps gemini git gopher http https irc ircs kitty mailto news sftp ssh

#: the set of url prefixes to look for when detecting a url under the
#: mouse cursor.

# detect_urls yes

#: detect urls under the mouse. detected urls are highlighted with an
#: underline and the mouse cursor becomes a hand over them. even if
#: this option is disabled, urls are still clickable. see also the
#: underline_hyperlinks option to control how hyperlinks (as opposed
#: to plain text urls) are displayed.

# url_excluded_characters

#: additional characters to be disallowed from urls, when detecting
#: urls under the mouse cursor. by default, all characters that are
#: legal in urls are allowed. additionally, newlines are allowed (but
#: stripped). this is to accommodate programs such as mutt that add
#: hard line breaks even for continued lines. \n can be added to this
#: option to disable this behavior. special characters can be
#: specified using backslash escapes, to specify a backslash use a
#: double backslash.

# show_hyperlink_targets no

#: when the mouse hovers over a terminal hyperlink, show the actual
#: url that will be activated when the hyperlink is clicked.

# underline_hyperlinks hover

#: control how hyperlinks are underlined. they can either be
#: underlined on mouse hover, always (i.e. permanently underlined) or
#: never which means that kitty will not apply any underline styling
#: to hyperlinks. note that the value of always only applies to real
#: (osc 8) hyperlinks not text that is detected to be a url on mouse
#: hover. uses the url_style and url_color settings for the underline
#: style. note that reloading the config and changing this value
#: to/from always will only affect text subsequently received by
#: kitty.

# copy_on_select no

#: copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. with this set to
#: clipboard, selecting text with the mouse will cause the text to be
#: copied to clipboard. useful on platforms such as macos that do not
#: have the concept of primary selection. you can instead specify a
#: name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer. map a shortcut
#: with the paste_from_buffer action to paste from this private
#: buffer. for example::

#:     copy_on_select a1
#:     map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

#: note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

# clear_selection_on_clipboard_loss no

#: when the contents of the clipboard no longer reflect the current
#: selection, clear it. this is primarily useful on platforms such as
#: linux where selecting text automatically copies it to a special
#: "primary selection" clipboard or if you have copy_on_select set to
#: clipboard.

#: note that on macos the system does not provide notifications when
#: the clipboard owner is changed, so there, copying to clipboard in a
#: non-kitty application will not clear selections even if
#: copy_on_select is enabled.

# paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt,confirm

#: a comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. the supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     if the text being pasted is a url and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the url (needs shell_integration).
#: replace-dangerous-control-codes
#:     replace dangerous control codes from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: replace-newline
#:     replace the newline character from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: confirm:
#:     confirm the paste if the text to be pasted contains any terminal control codes
#:     as this can be dangerous, leading to code execution if the shell/program running
#:     in the terminal does not properly handle these.
#: confirm-if-large
#:     confirm the paste if it is very large (larger than 16kb) as pasting
#:     large amounts of text into shells can be very slow.
#: filter:
#:     run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. the text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.
#: no-op:
#:     has no effect.

# strip_trailing_spaces never

#: remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. a
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. a value of always will always do it.

# select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#

#: characters considered part of a word when double clicking. in
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the unicode database will be matched.

# select_by_word_characters_forward

#: characters considered part of a word when extending the selection
#: forward on double clicking. in addition to these characters any
#: character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the
#: unicode database will be matched.

#: if empty (default) select_by_word_characters will be used for both
#: directions.

# click_interval -1.0

#: the interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

# focus_follows_mouse no

#: set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around. on macos, this will also cause the os window under
#: the mouse to be focused automatically when the mouse enters it.

# pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

#: the shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the
#: terminal grabs the mouse.

# default_pointer_shape beam

#: the default shape of the mouse pointer.

# pointer_shape_when_dragging beam crosshair

#: the default shape of the mouse pointer when dragging across text.
#: the optional second value sets the shape when dragging in
#: rectangular selection mode.

#: mouse actions {{{

#: mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. the
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. for example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the ctrl+shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. the value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. the values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: you can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. see the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: if you want to unmap a button, map it to nothing. for example, to
#: disable opening of urls with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed

#: see all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

# clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

# mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  first check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click

#: performance tuning {{{

 repaint_delay 8

#: delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (fps) at the cost of more cpu usage.
#: the default value yields ~100 fps which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. note that to actually achieve 100 fps, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

 input_delay 0

#: delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase cpu usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.
#: this setting is ignored when the input buffer is almost full.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. this
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: however, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. with a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. if so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: terminal bell {{{

# enable_audio_bell yes

#: the audio bell. useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: the visual bell duration (in seconds). flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. set to zero to disable.
#: the flash is animated, fading in and out over the specified
#: duration. the easing function used for the fading can be
#: controlled. for example, 2.0 linear will casuse the flash to fade
#: in and out linearly. the default if unspecified is to use ease-in-
#: out which fades slowly at the start, middle and end. you can
#: specify different easing functions for the fade-in and fade-out
#: parts, like this: 2.0 ease-in linear. kitty supports all the css
#: easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: us/docs/web/css/easing-function>.

# visual_bell_color none

#: the color used by visual bell. set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color. if you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: request window attention on bell. makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macos or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab "🔔 "

#: some text or a unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell. if you want to use leading
#: or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. see
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

#: for backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

# command_on_bell none

#: program to run when a bell occurs. the environment variable
#: kitty_child_cmdline can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

# bell_path none

#: path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. if set to none, the
#: system default bell sound is used. must be in a format supported by
#: the operating systems sound api, such as wav or oga on linux
#: (libcanberra) or aiff, mp3 or wav on macos (nssound). relative
#: paths are resolved with respect to the kitty config directory.

# linux_bell_theme __custom

#: the xdg sound theme kitty will use to play the bell sound. on
#: wayland, when the compositor supports it, it is asked to play the
#: system default bell sound, and this setting has no effect. note
#: that hyprland claims to support this protocol, but does not
#: actually play a sound
#: <https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland/issues/10488>. this setting
#: defaults to the custom theme name specified in the xdg sound theme
#: specification <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/sound-theme-
#: spec/latest/sound_lookup.html>, falling back to the default
#: freedesktop theme if it does not exist. to change your sound theme

#: }}}

#: window layout {{{

# remember_window_size  yes
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: if enabled, the os window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. if disabled, the os window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. you can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# remember_window_position no

#: if enabled, the os window position will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same position as the previous
#: instance. if disabled, the os window will be placed by the window
#: manager. note that remembering of position only works if the
#: underlying desktop environment/window manager supports it. it never
#: works on wayland. see also kitty --position to specify the position
#: when launching kitty.

# enabled_layouts *

#: the enabled window layouts. a comma separated list of layout names.
#: the special value all means all layouts. the first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. for a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: the step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. the cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

# window_border_width 0.5pt

#: the width of window borders. can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. if not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. they are meant to separate multiple windows.

# draw_minimal_borders yes

#: draw only the minimum borders needed. this means that only the
#: borders that separate the window from a neighbor are drawn. note
#: that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides this and
#: causes all borders to be drawn.

# draw_window_borders_for_single_window no

#: draw borders around a window even when there is only a single
#: window visible. when enabled and there is only a single window,
#: full borders are drawn around it (as if draw_minimal_borders is
#: false). the border will show in the active color when the window is
#: focused and the os window has focus, and in the inactive color when
#: the os window loses focus. this provides a clear visual indicator
#: of whether the kitty window is focused. when there are multiple
#: windows visible, this option has no effect and normal border
#: drawing rules apply.

# window_margin_width 0

#: the window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). a
#: single value sets all four sides. two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. three values set top, horizontal and bottom. four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_margin_width -1

#: the window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. a single value sets all four sides. two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# window_padding_width 0

#: the window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). a single value sets all four sides. two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_padding_width -1

#: the window padding to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). negative values will cause the value of window_padding_width
#: to be used instead. a single value sets all four sides. two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# placement_strategy center

#: when the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. you can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. a value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges. the value can be one of: top-
#: left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left, bottom,
#: bottom-right.

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: the color for the border of the active window. set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: the color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: the color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

# hide_window_decorations no

#: hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. on macos, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. when using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. or use titlebar-and-corners.

# window_logo_path none

#: path to a logo image. must be in png/jpeg/webp/gif/tiff/bmp format.
#: relative paths are interpreted relative to the kitty config
#: directory. the logo is displayed in a corner of every kitty window.
#: the position is controlled by window_logo_position. individual
#: windows can be configured to have different logos either using the
#: launch action or the remote control
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/> facility.

# window_logo_position bottom-right

#: where to position the window logo in the window. the value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

# window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: the amount the logo should be faded into the background. with zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

# window_logo_scale 0

#: the percentage (0-100] of the window size to which the logo should
#: scale. using a single number means the logo is scaled to that
#: percentage of the shortest window dimension, while preserving
#: aspect ratio of the logo image.

#: using two numbers means the width and height of the logo are scaled
#: to the respective percentage of the window's width and height.

#: using zero as the percentage disables scaling in that dimension. a
#: single zero (the default) disables all scaling of the window logo.

# resize_debounce_time 0.1 0.5

#: the time to wait (in seconds) before asking the program running in
#: kitty to resize and redraw the screen during a live resize of the
#: os window, when no new resize events have been received, i.e. when
#: resizing is either paused or finished. on platforms such as macos,
#: where the operating system sends events corresponding to the start
#: and end of a live resize, the second number is used for redraw-
#: after-pause since kitty can distinguish between a pause and end of
#: resizing. on such systems the first number is ignored and redraw is
#: immediate after end of resize. on other systems only the first
#: number is used so that kitty is "ready" quickly after the end of
#: resizing, while not also continuously redrawing, to save energy.

# resize_in_steps no

#: resize the os window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the os
#: window. note that this does not currently work on wayland.

# visual_window_select_characters 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

#: the list of characters for visual window selection. for example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. the
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set 0-9a-z\-=[];',./\\`. specify your
#: preference as a string of characters.

# confirm_os_window_close -1

#: ask for confirmation when closing an os window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. a value of
#: zero disables confirmation. this confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all os windows, via the
#: quit action). negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. you can also have
#: backgrounded jobs prevent closing, by adding count-background to
#: the setting, for example: -1 count-background. note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: tab bar {{{

# tab_bar_edge bottom

#: the edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: the margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

# tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: the margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). the first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the os window and the tab bar.
#: the second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

# tab_bar_style fade

#: the tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     each tab's edges fade into the background color. (see also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (see also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (see also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     a user-supplied python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. for examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. see also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     the tab bar is hidden. if you use this, you might want to create
#:     a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of
#:     tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

# tab_bar_filter

#: a search expression <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/#search-syntax>. only tabs that match this expression will
#: be shown in the tab bar. the currently active tab is always shown,
#: regardless of whether it matches or not. when using this option,
#: the tab bar may be displayed with less tabs than specified in
#: tab_bar_min_tabs, as evaluating the filter is expensive and is done
#: only at display time. this is most useful when using sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/sessions/>. an expression of
#: session:~ or session:^$ will show only tabs that belong to the
#: current session or no session. the various tab navigation actions
#: such as goto_tab, next_tab, previous_tab, etc. are automatically
#: restricted to work only on matching tabs.

# tab_bar_align left

#: the horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

# tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: the minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

# tab_switch_strategy previous

#: the algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. the default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. a value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. a value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. a value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. you
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " ┇"

#: the separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# tab_powerline_style angled

#: the powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

# tab_activity_symbol none

#: some text or a unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. if you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. see
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

# tab_title_max_length 0

#: the maximum number of cells that can be used to render the text in
#: a tab. a value of zero means that no limit is applied.

# tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{tab.last_focused_progress_percent}{title}"

#: a template to render the tab title. the default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. if you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab n. if you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. all data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     the current tab title.
#: index
#:     the tab index usable with goto_tab n goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     the current layout name.
#: session_name
#:     the name of the kitty session file from which this tab was created, if any.
#: active_session_name
#:     the name of the kitty session file from which the active window in this tab was created, if any.
#: num_windows
#:     the number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     the number of window groups (a window group is a window and all of its overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     the working directory of the currently active window in the tab
#:     (expensive, requires syscall). use tab.active_oldest_wd to get
#:     the directory of the oldest foreground process rather than the newest.
#: tab.active_exe
#:     the name of the executable running in the foreground of the currently
#:     active window in the tab (expensive, requires syscall). use
#:     tab.active_oldest_exe for the oldest foreground process.
#: max_title_length
#:     the maximum title length available.
#: keyboard_mode
#:     the name of the current keyboard mode <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/#modal-mappings> or the empty string if no keyboard mode is active.
#: tab.last_focused_progress_percent
#:     if a command running in a window reports the progress for a task, show this progress as a percentage
#:     from the most recently focused window in the tab. empty string if no progress is reported.
#: tab.progress_percent
#:     if a command running in a window reports the progress for a task, show this progress as a percentage
#:     from all windows in the tab, averaged. empty string is no progress is reported.
#: custom
#:     this will call a function named draw_title(data) from the file tab_bar.py placed in
#:     the kitty config directory. the function will be passed a dictionary of data, the same data that
#:     can be used in this template. it can then perform arbitrarily complex processing and return a string.
#:     for example: tab_title_template "{custom}" will use the output of the function as the tab title.
#:     any print statements in the draw_title() will print to the stdout of the kitty process, useful
#:     for debugging.


#: note that formatting is done by python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: if you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00ff00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: the 256 eight terminal colors can be used as `fmt.fg.color0`
#: through `fmt.fg.color255`. note that for backward compatibility, if
#: {bell_symbol} or {activity_symbol} are not present in the template,
#: they are prepended to it.

#: margins the default color is chosen to match the background color
#: of the neighboring tab.

#: }}}

#: color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: the foreground and background colors.

 background_opacity 0.8

#: the opacity of the terminal background color. a number between zero
#: and one, where one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. this
#: will only work if supported by the os (for instance, when using a
#: compositor under x11). note that it only sets the background
#: color's opacity in cells that have the same background color as the
#: default terminal background, so that things like the status bar in
#: vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good. but it means that if
#: you use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it
#: will not be rendered as transparent. instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor. see also transparent_background_colors. be
#: aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant)
#: performance hit. when using a low value for this setting, it is
#: desirable that you set the background color to a color the matches
#: the general color of the desktop background, for best text
#: rendering. note also, that this setting does not apply to the
#: background_image, if any. the background image can itself have
#: transparency via its alpha channel if desired, and that will be
#: respected.

#: if you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.

# background_blur 0

#: set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. on
#: macos, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. currently supported on
#: macos and kde.

# transparent_background_colors

#: a space separated list of upto 7 colors, with opacity. when the
#: background color of a cell matches one of these colors, it is
#: rendered semi-transparent using the specified opacity.

#: useful in more complex uis like editors where you could want more
#: than a single background color to be rendered as transparent, for
#: instance, for a cursor highlight line background or a highlighted
#: block. terminal applications can set this color using the kitty
#: color control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/color-stack/#color-
#: control> escape code.

#: the syntax for specifying colors is: color@opacity, where the
#: @opacity part is optional. when unspecified, the value of
#: background_opacity is used. for example::

#:     transparent_background_colors red@0.5 #00ff00@0.3

#: note that you must also set background_opacity to something less
#: than 1 for this setting to work properly.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_image none

#: path to a background image. must be in png/jpeg/webp/tiff/gif/bmp
#: format. note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. the value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. the scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio. note
#: that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_linear no

#: when background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used. note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint 0.0

#: how much to tint the background image by the background color. this
#: option makes it easier to read the text. tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. this option applies only
#: if background_image is set. note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: how much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look. note that when
#: using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# dim_opacity 0.4

#: how much to dim text that has the dim/faint attribute set. one
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: the foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: the color table {{{

#: advanced {{{

# shell .

#: the shell program to execute. the default value of . means to use
#: the value of of the shell environment variable or if unset,
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: note that on macos if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files. environment
#: variables are expanded in this setting.

# editor .

#: the terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: the default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: visual and editor in that order. if these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($shell -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set visual or editor. if that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

# close_on_child_death no

#: close the window when the child process (usually the shell) exits.
#: with the default value no, the terminal will remain open when the
#: child exits as long as there are still other processes outputting
#: to the terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded processes).
#: when enabled with yes, the window will close as soon as the child
#: process exits. note that setting it to yes means that any
#: background processes still using the terminal can fail silently
#: because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# remote_control_password

#: allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. this option
#: can be specified multiple times to add multiple passwords. if no
#: passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a
#: program tries to use remote control with a password. a password can
#: also *optionally* be associated with a set of allowed remote
#: control actions. for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab

#: only the specified actions will be allowed when using this
#: password. glob patterns can be used too, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

#: to get a list of available actions, run::

#:     kitten @ --help

#: a set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be
#: specified by using an empty password. for example::

#:     remote_control_password "" *-colors

#: finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides
#: a function is_cmd_allowed that is used to check every remote
#: control command. for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

#: relative paths are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.
#: see rc_custom_auth <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/#rc-custom-auth> for details.

# allow_remote_control no

#: allow other programs to control kitty. if you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. the default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. the meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:     remote control requests received over both the tty device and the socket
#:     are confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:     remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. requests received over the tty are denied.
#:     see listen_on.

#: socket
#:     remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. requests received over the tty are confirmed based on
#:     password.

#: no
#:     remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:     remote control requests are always accepted.

# listen_on none

#: listen to the specified socket for remote control connections. note
#: that this will apply to all kitty instances. it can be overridden
#: by the kitty --listen-on command line option. for unix sockets,
#: such as unix:${temp}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on linux).
#: environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. if {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the pid of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: pid of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: for tcp sockets such as tcp:localhost:0 a random port is always
#: used even if a non-zero port number is specified.  see the help for
#: kitty --listen-on for more details. note that this will be ignored
#: unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes, socket or
#: socket-only. changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# env

#: specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env var=) will set it to
#: the empty string. specifying only the name (e.g. env var) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env var1=a
#:     env var2=${home}/${var1}/b

#: the value of var2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

#: use the special value read_from_shell to have kitty read the
#: specified variables from your login shell shell configuration.
#: useful if your shell startup files setup a bunch of environment
#: variables that you want available to kitty and in kitty session
#: files. each variable name is treated as a glob pattern to match.
#: for example: env read_from_shell=path lang lc_* xdg_* editor
#: visual. note that these variables are only read after the
#: configuration is fully processed, thus they are not available for
#: recursive expansion and they will override any variables set by
#: other env directives.

# filter_notification

#: specify rules to filter out notifications sent by applications
#: running in kitty. can be specified multiple times to create
#: multiple filter rules. a rule specification is of the form
#: field:regexp. a filter rule can match on any of the fields: title,
#: body, app, type. the special value of all filters out all
#: notifications. rules can be combined using boolean operators. some
#: examples::

#:     filter_notification title:hello or body:"abc.*def"
#:     # filter out notification from vim except for ones about updates, (?i)
#:     # makes matching case insensitive.
#:     filter_notification app:"[ng]?vim" and not body:"(?i)update"
#:     # filter out all notifications
#:     filter_notification all

#: the field app is the name of the application sending the
#: notification and type is the type of the notification. not all
#: applications will send these fields, so you can also match on the
#: title and body of the notification text. more sophisticated
#: programmatic filtering and custom actions on notifications can be
#: done by creating a notifications.py file in the kitty config
#: directory (~/.config/kitty). an annotated sample is available
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/docs/notifications.py>.

# watcher

#: path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>. can be
#: specified more than once to load multiple watchers. the watchers
#: will be added to every kitty window. relative paths are resolved
#: relative to the kitty config directory. note that reloading the
#: config will only affect windows created after the reload.

# exe_search_path

#: control where kitty finds the programs to run. the default search
#: order is: first search the system wide path, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. if still not found, the path defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. finally, if present,
#: the path specified by the env option is tried.

#: this option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. it can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. a simple path will be prepended to the search order. a path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. a path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. for example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

# update_check_interval 24

#: the interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). if an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. the default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

# startup_session none

#: path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session =none command line option
#: for individual instances. see sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/sessions/> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported. note that if kitty is invoked with command
#: line arguments specifying a command to run, this option is ignored.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. you can control exactly which actions are allowed. the
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. the
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via ssh can read your clipboard. see also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: the maximum size (in mb) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. a value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. see also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: the password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. this should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

# allow_hyperlinks yes

#: process hyperlink escape sequences (osc 8). if disabled osc 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. the
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

# shell_integration enabled

#: enable shell integration on supported shells. this enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. it is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete, no-sudo. see shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

# allow_cloning ask

#: control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. the canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: by default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over ssh) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. the supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     source the file $virtual_env/bin/activate. this is used by the
#:     python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     run conda activate $conda_default_env. this supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     kitty_clone_source_code with eval.
#: path
#:     source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     kitty_clone_source_path.

#: this option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: only the first valid match, in the order specified, is sourced.

# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). the possible values are:

#: never
#:     never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its os window
#:     is not currently visible (on platforms that support os window visibility querying
#:     this considers an os window visible iff it is active).

#: always
#:     always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: there are two optional arguments:

#: first, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. the default is 5 seconds. specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. for example: invisible 15. do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new os window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: second, the action to perform. the default is notify. the possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     send a desktop notification. the subsequent arguments are optional and specify when
#:     the notification is automatically cleared. the set of possible events when the notification is
#:     cleared are: focus and next. focus means that when the notification
#:     policy is unfocused or invisible the notification is automatically cleared
#:     when the window regains focus. the value of next means that the previous notification
#:     is cleared when the next notification is shown. the default when no arguments are specified
#:     is: focus next.

#: bell
#:     ring the terminal bell.

#: notify-bell
#:     send a desktop notification and ring the terminal bell.
#:     the arguments are the same as for `notify`.

#: command
#:     run a custom command. all subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: some more examples::

#:     # send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     # here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c
#:     # do not clear previous notification when next command finishes or window regains focus
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 5.0 notify

# term xterm-kitty

#: the value of the term environment variable to set. changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "stack overflow"
#: to change it. the term variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. if
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# terminfo_type path

#: the value of the terminfo environment variable to set. this
#: variable is used by programs running in the terminal to search for
#: terminfo databases. the default value of path causes kitty to set
#: it to a filesystem location containing the kitty terminfo database.
#: a value of direct means put the entire database into the env var
#: directly. this can be useful when connecting to containers, for
#: example. but, note that not all software supports this. a value of
#: none means do not touch the variable.

# forward_stdio no

#: forward stdout and stderr of the kitty process to child processes.
#: this is useful for debugging as it allows child processes to print
#: to kitty's stdout directly. for example, echo hello world
#: >&$kitty_stdio_forwarded in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's stdout. sets the kitty_stdio_forwarded=fdnum environment
#: variable so child processes know about the forwarding. note that on
#: macos this prevents the shell from being run via the login utility
#: so getlogin() will not work in programs run in this session.

# menu_map

#: specify entries for various menus in kitty. currently only the
#: global menubar on macos is supported. for example::

#:    menu_map global "actions::launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: this will create a menu entry named "launch something special" in
#: an "actions" menu in the macos global menubar. sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

#: }}}

#: os specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: the color of the kitty window's titlebar on wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as gnome. a value of system
#: means to use the default system colors, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active kitty window
#: and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macos. a value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. a value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_option_as_alt no

#: use the option key as an alt key on macos. with this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macos native option+key to enter unicode
#: character behavior. this will break any alt+key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macos unicode input
#: technique. you can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both option keys as alt, instead. note that
#: kitty itself always treats option the same as alt. this means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: option+key vs. alt+key. also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: option/alt+key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: hide the kitty window from running tasks on macos (⌘+tab and the
#: dock). changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macos.
#: by default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as
#: is the expected behavior on macos.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: disable this if you want kitty top-level os windows to not be
#: resizable on macos.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macos. for example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes. note that in modern kitty,
#: this option is obsolete (although still supported). consider using
#: text_composition_strategy instead.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: use the macos traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: control where the window title is displayed on macos. a value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macos window. a value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macos global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. a value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. see
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: the maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macos global menu bar. values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: use a custom mouse cursor for macos that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. nowadays, the default macos cursor
#: already comes with a white border. warning: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual gpu machines. changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: the colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. the default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. the
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. the value of displayp3 will use apple's special
#: snowflake display p3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created os
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto

#: choose between wayland and x11 backends. by default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# wayland_enable_ime yes

#: enable input method extension on wayland. this is typically used
#: for inputting text in east asian languages. however, its
#: implementation in wayland is often buggy and introduces latency
#: into the input loop, so disable this if you know you dont need it.
#: changing this option by reloading the config is not supported, it
#: will not have any effect.

#: }}}

#: keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: keys are identified simply by their lowercase unicode characters.
#: for example: a for the a key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. for functional keys, such as enter or escape, the names are
#: present at functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: for modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt

#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: the full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. you can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: e.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. for example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: e.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. this option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. it causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. so the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: clipboard {{{

#: copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#::  there is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to ctrl+c. it will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection. the copy_or_noop
#::  action will copy if there is a selection and pass the key through
#::  to the application running in the terminal if there is no
#::  selection.

#: pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  you can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. by default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. for
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#::  you can pass the current selection to a terminal program running
#::  in a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#::      map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: scroll to next shell prompt

# map kitty_mod+x scroll_to_prompt 1

#: browse scrollback buffer in pager

# map kitty_mod+h show_scrollback

#::  you can pipe the contents of the current screen and history
#::  buffer as stdin to an arbitrary program using launch --stdin-

#::  less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +g -r

#::  for more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#::  programs, see launch <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: browse output of the last shell command in pager

# map kitty_mod+g show_last_command_output

#::  you can also define additional shortcuts to get the command
#::  output. for example, to get the first command output on screen::

#::      map f1 show_first_command_output_on_screen

#::  to get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard
#::  action or mouse action::

#::      map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

#::  you can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell
#::  using the launch action. for example, the following opens the
#::  output in less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +g -r

#::  to get the output of the first command on the screen, use
#::  @first_cmd_output_on_screen. to get the output of the last jumped
#::  to command, use @last_visited_cmd_output.

#::  requires shell integration
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> to work.

#: search the scrollback within a pager

# map kitty_mod+/ search_scrollback
# map cmd+f       search_scrollback

#::  search for currently selected text in the scrollback using the
#::  configured scrollback_pager. assumes that pressing the / key
#::  triggers search mode in the pager. if you want to create a manual
#::  mapping with a special pager for this, you can use something
#::  like:

#::      map f1 combine : launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay mypager : send_key /

#::  for more sophisticated control, such as using the current
#::  selection, use remote_control_script.

#: window management {{{

#: new window

# map kitty_mod+enter new_window
# map cmd+enter       new_window

#::  you can open a new kitty window running an arbitrary program, for
#::  example::

#::  you can open a new window with the current working directory set
#::  to the working directory of the current window using::

#::      map ctrl+alt+enter launch --cwd=current

#::  you can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via

#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active
#::      # erase the last command and its output (needs shell integration to work)
#::      map f1 clear_terminal last_command active

#::  if you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files
#::  to perform various kinds of clearing of the current window:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      clear-only-screen() {
#::          printf "\e[h\e[2j"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-and-scrollback() {

#::      clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[h\e[22j"
#::      }

#::  for instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap
#::  ctrl+l to both scroll the current screen contents into the
#::  scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing
#::  the screen. for zsh, in ~/.zshrc, add:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      ctrl_l() {
#::          builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0j\e[h\e[22j' >"$tty"

#::          builtin zle -r
#::      }
#::      zle -n ctrl_l
#::      bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

#::  alternatively, you can just add map ctrl+l clear_terminal
#::  to_cursor_scroll active to kitty.conf which works with no changes
#::  to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does
#::  not clear any text at the prompt itself.

#: reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macos global menu

#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. useful for debugging issues.

#: send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  e.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all hello world

#::  you can tell kitty to send arbitrary (utf-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. for
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all special text

#::  this will send "special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#::  combination. the text to be sent decodes ansi c escapes
#::  <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ansi_002dc-
#::  quoting.html> so you can use escapes like \e to send control
#::  codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can just input
#::  the unicode characters directly as utf-8 text). you can use
#::  `kitten show-key` to get the key escape codes you want to
#::  emulate.

#::  the first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. the possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. the
#::  modes normal and application refer to the decckm cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. the special value all means all of them.

#::  some more examples::

#::      # output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal word\e[h
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application word\eoh
